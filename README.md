# Deepfake_detection
Detecting celebrity deep fakes using resnext and LSTM.
## Dataset:
I have used a mixed dataset from various sources like Kaggle etc. It is quite large in size hence I have stashed it in Google Drive. 
## Models:
Resnext 50 is used to extarct the feature vector and an LSTM network has been added for spatial analysis.
