# Deepfake_detection
Detecting celebrity deep fakes using resnext and LSTM.
## Dataset:
I have used a mixed dataset from various sources like Kaggle etc. It is quite large in size hence I have stashed it in Google Drive. 
## Models:
Resnext 50 is used to extarct the feature vector and an LSTM network has been added for spatial analysis.
I have also uploaded the trained model which I had used for final predictions. It can be directly used to predict on a dataset, given that the necessary pre-proceesing on has been done on the videos, the code for which can be found in the predicting.ipynb file.
